<h1>Amarjeet Gill's List of The Greatest Movies of All Time</h1>

<h2>Amarjeet's top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Digimon: The Movie</h3>
<p>This is a movie that is very close to my heart. I used to watch the original Digimon television show back in the 90's when I was just a kid and it was quite the experience seeing the protagonists on the big screen. It follows the adventures of the original digidestined as well as the following generation (season 2) as they fight off great evil inside and outside the internet. I also have a fond memory of being at the dentist once as a little kid. The dentist was really kind and she could tell I was afraid, so she gave me headphones and put on the first season of Digimon on the TV. This calmed my nerves enough to make it a really memorable experience. Mostly because of Tai and Agumon's goofy introduction in the first episode, which would lead to many great adventures and a strong friendship down the road.</p>
<h3>Gundam 00: Awakening of The Trailblazer</h3>
<p>I'm a big fan of the entire Mobile Suit: Gundam franchise and this is probably my favorite movie from the franchise. It follows the Gundam Meisters of Celestial Being as they discover and battle a new extraterrestrial threat heading for Earth. New generation Gundams and Earth Sphere Federation mobile suits are deployed in combat and new and powerful advances in weapons technology are shown. It's really cool and a must see for all Mobile Suit: Gundam fans.</p>
<h3>Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions</h3>
<p>The story is quite emotional and epic. It takes place after the events of the television show, which saw Yugi Muto and Pharoah Atem's final duel and the Pharoah returning to his own world. Everyone, especially Yugi is trying to adjust to a "normal" life without the pharoah (though this proves difficult as they shared a body for so long, and he misses him greatly). Kaiba is also desperately trying to resurrect the pharoah so as to settle the score between them, going so far as to dig up the pieces of the millenium puzzle to try and bring him back. The story takes us into the depths of the main characters and our new enemies and is quite nostalgic. It's a good watch for sure.</p><!-- Write your code below -->
