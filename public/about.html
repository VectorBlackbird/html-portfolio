<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there. My name is Amarjeet Gill. I'm an aspiring Fullstack Web Developer. My highschool educational beckground mostly consists of courses in mathematics and the sciences, such as physics, chemistry, calculus, and so forth.
  I proceeded to attend post secondary at York University, where I was pursuing a childhood ambition of obtaining an engineering degree. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but due to my personal and family situation, it was no longer a beneficial pursuit for me.
  I was quite good with computer principles and computer networking and hardware (picked up as a hobby), so after the recommendation of a dear friend I decided to take up Fullstack Web Development which I was taught by Dr. Angela Yu.</p>

<p>Apart from my formal education, I do have some hard skills that I have picked up along the way, which have allowed me to build a strong technical expertise.
  I can prepare, crimp, and test ethernet cable (the highest I've done is category 8 double shielded, rated for 40+ gbps) as well as fiber optic cabling. I have strong low voltage electrical skills, software diagnostic skills in the automotive field,
  I can solder circuit boards, set up and configure computer networks, and repair/interchange computer components and other electronic parts.
</p>

<p>I am quite hard working. If I'm missing certain knowledge and skills requried to do a task or job, I go out of my way to learn it and master it the best I can.
  When given a problem to solve, I do devlope something akin to tunnel vision and focus greatly on finding a solution to the issue at hand. I'm easy to get along with, and work very well with others. I am calm and clear in situations of stress, prioritizing solutions rather than getting mixed up in chaos.
  I am proud to say, I have high emotional intelligence and am very respectful. Thank you for reading a bit about me, I very much look forward to working with you!
